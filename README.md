# Elo-Poisson Sports-Betting
A reproducible Python toolkit that:
1. Builds Elo ratings from historical match results  
2. Fits Poisson goal models  
3. Optimises the Elo *K* via maximum-likelihood for **1Ã—2** or **Under/Over** markets  
4. Generates implied probabilities, edges and fractional-Kelly stakes

Also includes a notebook exploring a mixed effects model.
